*** Changes to existing pages/functionality
+ [ ] Hamburger/Drawer
  + Should auto-collapse when click outside of it
  + Page content should shift over when drawer expands
+ [X] Landing/Sign-on
  + Change "Get Started" to "Sign in with Google"
  + remove sign-on page

+ [ ] Personas/Connect
  + Need better way to display personas and connect them with accounts
    + Combine them; likely collapse "Connect" page into the "Personas" page
  + Note on associativity of personas and accounts
    + User has 0+ personas
    + Persona associated with 0-4 platform accounts; at most one per platform
    + Platform accounts associated with exactly 1 persona
+ [ ] Generate
  + Scrollable horizontal list with "tiles" for each persona at top
  + Clicking tile highlights/outlines selected persona tile
  + "Generate Post" workflow / form appears under the top scroller list
  + Instead of "Accept", shows "Post to..." button(s), "Save to Drafts" button, and "Reject"/garbage can icon
+ [ ] Posts -> Rename to "Content"
  + Add table column which displays icons of platforms to which item (row) has been posted
*** TODO for P3
+ [X] Setup redux for state management
+ [X] Store user credentials from Google auth on login, remove on logout
+ [ ] Store default personas and posts, update on change
